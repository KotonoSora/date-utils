## npm scripts

date-utils repository has some npm scripts to help you develop efficiently.

- `npm install`: install all dependencies
- `npm run build.watch`: build `date-utils` and rebuild it when changes are made
- `npm run types`: emit types, usually only need to run only once
- `npm run test`: run Jest at `__tests__/index.test.ts` (you will work with this file most of the time)

## Run locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the real demo app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run jest tests and date-utils server simultaneously:

```bash
npm run test
```

However, it's recommended to run jest tests and date-utils server separately:

```bash
npm run test # Run jest
```

## Repository architecture

Following are brief descriptions of the repository architecture:

- [src](https://github.com/KotonoSora/date-utils/tree/main/src/): contains most of the code of date-utils such as `getKeyMonthFromToDate` function, `getPageMonth` function, all types, etc.S
- [dist](https://github.com/KotonoSora/date-utils/tree/main/dist/): Distribution code, which is bundled and processed by Rollup (previously: Vite Library Mode).

## Submit a PR

So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.

There are a few things when you open a PR:

1. Make sure CI passes
2. Prefer atomic commits
3. Prefer rebase over merge: If you create a new branch from `master` and work on it for a while. There is a chance that `master` will be updated and there will be a conflict between `master` and your branch. We would love to have you rebase your branch on top of `master` instead of merging it when your PR is ready.

## Closing

We would love to have you on the list of contributors and thank you for your contribution. Happy coding!
